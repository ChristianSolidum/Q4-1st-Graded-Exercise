Q3 - rujia (p12554)
========================

There are n people (excluding myself) in my 30th birthday party. They sing the traditional “happy
birthday” song:

> *Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to Rujia! Happy birthday to you!!!*

Since I love music, I want to hear something more interesting, not that everyone sings together. Ah yes, I want one person to sing one word!

For example, there are three people: Mom, Dad, Girlfriend, I’d like them to sing like this:

```
Mom: Happy
Dad: birthday
Girlfriend: to
Mom: you
Dad: Happy
Girlfriend: birthday
Mom: to
Dad: you
Girlfriend: Happy
Mom: birthday
Dad: to
Girlfriend: Rujia
Mom: Happy
Dad: birthday
Girlfriend: to
Mom: you
```

Very nice, right? What if there are more than 16 people? That’s easy: repeat the song until
everyone has sung at least once :)

Please, don’t stop in the middle of the song.

## Input

letters). Each name contains at most 100 characters and do not have whitespace characters inside.
